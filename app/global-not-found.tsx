/**
 * The 404 for a URL that matches no route at all.
 *
 * Needed because the app has two root layouts — the site and the admin area —
 * so an unmatched URL belongs to neither and Next.js has no layout to compose
 * a 404 from. Without this file it falls back to the framework's own bare page,
 * which is what happened the moment the admin root layout was added.
 *
 * It renders its own document for that reason, and reuses the section from
 * `(site)/not-found.tsx` so the two 404s — this one and the one a route throws
 * — stay the same page.
